stance with which he promptly acquainted Leverrier.
The latter journeyed to Org√©res and there gleaned
what he looked upon as highly satisfactory information.
That is how the matter came to be presented by
Leverrier to the Academy.

Vulcan has had every chance to reveal itself since
the days of Leverrier and Lescarbault. It has not
done so, and the only reasonable conclusion, I think,
is that there is no such planet to be revealed. In the
year 1876 a German astronomer stationed in China,
saw a small black spot on the solar disk and found
that it quickly vanished. He promptly telegraphed
the news to Europe that Vulcan had at last reappeared.
Observations made at Greenwich and Madrid, however,
proved that the alleged planet was merely a sunspot
which had been carried out of view by the solar
rotation.

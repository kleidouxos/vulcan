for the number of actual physical planets is eleven, including Vulcan and
the two outside Neptune, and then the Sun makes up the twelve. This
number, however, apparently varies at different periods in the vast history
of the whole system, and changes occur in enormously long rhythms to
which science has as yet no clue. Our earth Chain has three of its globes
on the physical plane, and the same is true of the Neptune Chain; but
this was not the case in the far past, nor will it always be so in the long

distant future.

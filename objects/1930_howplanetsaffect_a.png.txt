92. HOW PLANETS AFFECT PEOPLE

It is not taken for granted the planet
is a newcomer in our solar system any
more than Uranus and Neptune were
newcomers at moment of their discov-
ery. Mythology provides plenty of
references to justify a belief that the an-
cients were long aware of their presence.
likewise there are references to ultra-
Neptunian bodies and an intra-Mercur-
ial body named Vulcan. Vulcan, how-
ever, probably never will be photograph-
ed by present-day methods because it is
in a spiritualized condition with rarified
rays of vibration which do not photo-
graph. It has probably passed through
all the stages of evolution which the
other planets are now undergoing and is
preparing to enter the “bosom of the
father” i.e., return into the Sun, after
which Mercury will in turn succeed to
its state as will all the other planets in
the course of time. Astrologers have
computed the ephemeris of Vulcan and
many have tested its influence to their
Astronomers must develop

  

means of photography before be-
ing able to “discover” Vulcan, but the
findings of Astrology are a significant in-
dication that eventually it, too, will be
“discovered.”

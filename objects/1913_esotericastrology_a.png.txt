The seven planetary Logoi are represented on the physical plane
by the planets Vulcan, Venus, the Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and
Neptune. Each of these is globe D in a septenary Chain; so that
although the Earth and Neptune are at the same evolutionary stage,
they belong to quite different types. The Sun, the eighth, is the great
Father of the seven Fathers ; for each of these seven Planetary Logoi is
the “‘ Father in Heaven ” of those souls who belong to His type of spiritual

evolution.

If we weren’t so accustomed to Science in its essential aspect of
Disregard, we’d be mystified and impressed, like the Editor of
Nature, with the formulation of these data: agreement of so many
instances would seem incredible as a coincidence: but our acceptance
is that, with just enough disregard, astronomers and fortune-tellers
can formulate anything—or we’d engage, ourselves, to formulate
periodicities in the crowds in Broadway—say that every Wednesday
morning, a tall man, with one leg and a black eye, carrying a rubber
plant, passes the Singer Building, at quarter past ten o’clock. Of
course it couldn’t really be done, unless such a man did have such
periodicity, but if some Wednesday mornings it should be a small
child lugging a barrel, or a fat negress with a week’s wash, by or-
dinary disregard that would be prediction good enough for the
kind of quasi-existence we’re in.

So whether we accuse, or whether we think that the word “ac-
cuse” over-dignifies an attitude toward a quasi-astronomer, or mere
figment in a super-dream, our acceptance is that Leverrier never did
formulate observations——

That he picked out observations that could be formulated——

That of this type are all formulas——

That, if Leverrier had not been himself helplessly hypnotized, or
if he had had in him more than a tincture of realness, never could he
have been beguiled by such a quasi-process: but that he was hypno-
tized, and so extended, or transferred, his condition to others, that
upon March 22, 1877, he had this earth bristling with telescopes,
with the rigid and almost inanimate forms of astronomers behind
them——

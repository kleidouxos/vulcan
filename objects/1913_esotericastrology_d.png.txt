On May 19th, 1885, that highly skilled observer,
Mr. T. W. Backhouse, of Sunderland, wrote to The
Astronomical Register as follows: “Again at the
spring node of the accepted orbit of the suppostitious
Vulcan the sun was examined here each day (except
Sundays) when the weather allowed, over the period
during which a transit is possible, according to
Leverrier, but with no positive result. It may be
added with confidence that no planet-like object,
certainly none with motion relative to spots, etc., was
visible on the sun’s disk at nearly all the times of my
observations between March 15th and April 18th.”

Including the Sun and Moon, and counting in
Vulcan, Neptune and the Asteroids, we have
again the twelve complete mystic influences. .

Vulcan, the planet nearest the sun has only
lately been discovered and has as yet no ephem-
erides. But judging by the date of its dis-
covery and the characteristics of its newest
neighbors it may very well be the Genius of
the Times, the Progressive Awakening Spirit
which has sent the world farther in the last hun-
dred years than in ten hundred before it.

Mercury, the next from the Sun, is the planet of
Memory and Perception. It gives physical power
and a great desire for the acquirement of new
knowledge and sciences.

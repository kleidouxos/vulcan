But he placed the time of best observation away up in 1877.

But even so, or considering that he still had probably a good many
years to live, it may strike one that he was a little rash—that is if
one have not gone very deep into the study of hypnoses—that, hav-
ing “discovered” Neptune by a method which, in our acceptance,
had no more to recommend it than had once equally well-thought-of
methods of witch-finding, he should not have taken such chances:
that if he was right as to Neptune, but should be wrong as to!
“Vulcan,” his average would be away below that of most fortune-
tellers, who could scarcely hope ‘to do business upon a fifty per cent.
basis—all that the reasoning of a tyro in hypnoses.

March 22, 1877.

The scientific world was up on its hind legs nosing the sky. The
thing had been done so authoritatively. Never a pope had said a
thing with more of the seeming of finality. If six observations cor-
related, what more could be asked? The Editor of Nature, a week
before the predicted event, though cautious, said that it is difficult
to explain how six observers, unknown to one another, could have
data that could be formulated, if they were not related phenomena.

In a way, at this point occurs the crisis of our whole book.

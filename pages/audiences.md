## The Audiences of Science Communication

The purpose of this collection was to bring together the diverse audiences of 19th century science communication. A vocabulary was needed to identify and catalog these audiences for browsing purposes. This page servers to justify this language, which began with a cursory overview of the collected references and has been refined and expanded as patterns emerged.

### Academic

The primary audience of most scientific and philosophical writing are other scholars. Works of academia generally assume of the read a high degree of familiarity with existing literature within the field, and this is true of the 19th century even though the culture assumed will be markedly different than a scholar of the 21st century.

### Student

This classification is reserved for books which self-identify as textbooks or introductions to an academic field. Student texts are specifically meant to educate and enculturate a younger generation of scholars.

### Popular

The audiences of popular science are often well-informed in the sense of general, worldly knowledge, and they may well recall with the people and surfaces of recent scholarly advances. These texts include newspapers, magazines, and other serials, where the generalized context is markedly clear, but may also include books of a general interest nature. The authors of these texts tend to report on what another has accomplished or argued. Popular texts are far more likely to involve humor and to appeal to politics and nationality.

As remains true today, popular science typically involves a limited set of scientific questions where novel conclusions and suggestions take priority over tables of evidence. In the context of 19th century astronomy, these topics included the discovery of new asteroids, eclipses, the possibility of life on another planet, and the construction of new telescopes.

### Esoteric

A less widely acknowledged audience for science are seekers and practitioners of western esoteric traditions. Esoteric texts cross many of the lines drawn above. Due to millennia of foundational texts, various schools of practice, and a culture of initiation, esoteric works are often as encircled as scholarship and rely equally on dense references. Yet an esoteric text may also seek to educate a student or entertain a general audience.

The texts marked *esoteric* in this collection are primarily astrological. The late 19th century saw a marked rise in interest in astrology, which would soon gain more momentum with the growth and popularization of personality theories in psychology. This interest of western esotericism in contemporary science and scholarship has long bee a consistent aspect of its internal narratives. The seance culture of the 19th century was informed by contemporary theories of electromagnetic waves just as quantum uncertainty is used today to explain the law of attraction. While the Vulcan hypothesis was current (and for a little while after as the [timeline](https://kleidouxos.github.io/vulcan/timeline.html) shows, the inclusion of the planet in astrological texts may have been read by esoteric audiences as a distinction from the repackaged and hackneyed.

## Notes

Noticeably this classification is based upon less formal features than the Library of Congress's [*target audience*](https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd521.html) codes. Academics are readers of newspapers, and the line between works for popular and student audience is as much a function of syllabus-crafting and individual interest as it is anything contained within the text itself or in a publisher's catalogs. The classification presented here should be read as shorthand for the sum of various features: the technical aspects of a work (figures, precision), its press and circulation, the reading-level of the language, and whether and which secondary works the text is in conversation with.

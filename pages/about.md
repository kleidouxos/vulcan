## The Afterlives of Scientific Ideas

The Vulcan saga is a prominent example of a very public claim-and-retraction cycle, and one that resurfaced periodically for half a century. Retractions are among the types of scientific information which highlight the problems of the "deficit model" of science communication: the belief that increasing access to information is sufficient to advance the public objections of the scientific community. Once science enters culture, its claims, conjectures, and personae operate as culture, forming productive elements of identity and communication.

!! BETTER DEFINITIONS, FROM SOURCES

This collection was organized with the belief that reading histories of what science has meant to diverse audiences will help historians of science.

Historians of science rarely read histories of newspapers and publishing
Definition of science - interest, funding, growth, induction of young scientists, fame
Public: metaphor, myth, needs, identity and ideology...
Vulcan chosen because of retraction

## Planet Vulcan

In 1846, the French astronomer Urbain Le Verrier used data from the orbital irregularities of the planet Uranus to predict an eighth planet, which was soon sighted and today we call Neptune. Satisfied with his methods, Le Verrier turned his attention to the orbit Mercury, which displayed similar irregularities that couldn't be explained with Newtonian mechanics. He predicted another planet, and in 1859, a French country physician and amateur astronomy Edmond Modeste Lescarbault witnessed an object traversing across the sun. After inspecting the country doctor's instruments, Le Verrier declared the object to be Vulcan. But the size and motion of Lescarbault's Vulcan didn't complete the mathematical picture, and the profession remaned skeptical.

For decades each eclipse brought out Vulcan-spotters with varying results. In the late 19th century, scientists were only beginning to theorize on sun spots and solar flares and to speculate on the chemical composition of astronomical bodies. This was also an era of intense and competitive hunting for asteroids, which at the time were known as minor planets. One of these, University of Michigan's James Craig Watson, claimed to have spotted Vulcan in 1878, reviving interest again.

In a 1919 eclipse, the British astronomers Frank Watson Dyson and Arthur Stanley Eddington returned to the problem of Mercury to find proof of general relativity. Their observations were widely heralded for confirming Einstein's work and for explaining the procession of Mercury. Thereafter, the search for a "Planet X" focused on the outer bounds of the solar system, and eventually peaked with the discovery of Pluto in 1930.

## The Afterlives of Scientific Ideas

The Vulcan saga is a prominent example of a very public claim-and-retraction cycle, and one that resurfaced periodically for half a century. Retractions are among the types of scientific information which highlight the problems of the "deficit model" of science communication: the belief that increasing access to information is sufficient to improve public attitudes toward science. Once science enters culture, its claims, conjectures, and personae operate as culture, forming productive elements of identity and communication. 

This collection was organized under the philosophy that the public understanding of science has a place in the history of science and that the latter field benefits from considering how science operates as culture. Topics such as the education of young scientists, the motivations of scientists, and the sourcing of funding and instruments all rely in part on the interests and perceptions of non-specialists. Outside of its own magic circle of logic, science exists as metaphor, mythology, ideology, identity, curiosity, and need.

Vulcan, the planet that never was, takes on many guises in this library. It was modernity itself, and it was a Victorian mistake. At once a symbol of hope, failure, and success. I invite you to consider these lenses as you peruse this digital library.

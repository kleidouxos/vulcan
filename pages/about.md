## Planet Vulcan

In 1846, the French astronomer Urbain Leverrier compiled data from the orbital irregularities of the planet Uranus to calculate an eighth planet. That planet was soon sighted within a degree of his estimate, and today we call Neptune. Satisfied with his methods, Leverrier turned his attention to the orbit Mercury, for which his analysis proved similar irregularities that couldn't be explained with Newtonian mechanics. In 1859 he announced his prediction of another planet between Mercury and the Sun. 

Within the year, a French country physician and amateur astronomy Edmond Modeste Lescarbault witnessed an dark spot traversing across the sun. After inspecting the country doctor's instruments, Le Verrier declared the object fit his prediction. This object was named Vulcan. Yet the size and motion of Lescarbault's Vulcan didn't complete the mathematical picture. Furthermore, Emmanuel Liais, a French astronomer working in Brazil in 1859, had been observing the sun at the same time as Lescarbault and he'd seen nothing.

The profession remained skeptical.

For decades after each eclipse brought out Vulcan-spotters with varying results. In the late 19th century, scientists were only beginning to theorize on sun spots and solar flares and to speculate on the chemical composition of astronomical bodies. This was also an era of intense and competitive hunting for asteroids, which at the time were known as minor planets. One of these, University of Michigan's James Craig Watson, claimed to have spotted Vulcan in 1878, reviving interest again. Lewis Swift in Rochester, New York, independently confirmed Watson's claim.

During a 1919 eclipse, the British astronomers Frank Watson Dyson and Arthur Stanley Eddington found proof of general relativity: starlight was shown to bend under the sun's gravity. Their observations were widely heralded for confirming Einstein's work and for explaining the apparent orbit of Mercury. The question settled, the scientific search for a new planet focused on the outer bounds of the solar system, and eventually peaked with the discovery of Pluto in 1930.

## The Afterlives of Scientific Ideas

The Vulcan saga is a prominent example of a very public claim-and-retraction cycle, and one that resurfaced periodically for half a century. Retractions are among the types of scientific information which highlight the problems of the "deficit model" of science communication: the belief that increasing access to information is sufficient to improve public attitudes toward science. Once science enters culture, its claims, conjectures, and personae operate as culture, forming productive elements of identity and communication. Hypothesis, probability, and proof are operationally different, and a public can be resistant or resentful over changes in information. 

This collection was organized under the philosophy that the *public understanding of science* has a place in the *history of science* and that both fields might benefit from cross-pollination. For the historians, topics such as the education of young scientists, the motivations of scientists, and the sourcing of funding and instruments all rely in part on the interests and perceptions of non-specialists. Outside of its own magic circle of practice and logic, science exists as metaphor, mythology, ideology, identity, curiosity, and need, which are each cultural and historical processes.

Vulcan, the planet that never was, takes on many guises in this library. It was modernity itself, and it was a Victorian mistake. It was the clash of empiricism and idealism. A mathematical marvel and a pernicious waste of effort. Vulcan was at once a symbol of hope, failure, and success. I invite you to consider these lenses as you peruse this digital library.

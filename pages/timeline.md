## Collection Timeline

Background:
* 1846: France: Urbain Le Verrier predicts the planet Neptune. Jacques Babinet proposes an intra-Mercurial planet and floats the name Vulcan.
* 1856: France: Based on Mercury's orbit, Le Verrier predicts the orbit of planet Vulcan; Edmond Modeste Lescarbault claims to have seen it.
* 1878: United States: Famed asteroid-hunter James Craig Watson claims to have seen Vulcan from Michigan; Lewis Swift in Rochester, New York, makes the same claim.
* Subsequent eclipses: 1883, 1887, 1889, 1900, 1901, 1905, and 1908.
* 1908: Astronomers at the Lick Observatory in California conclude, based on data from the past four eclipses, that the Vulcan hypothesis has been falsified.
